To address this issue, we present a comprehensive\nreview and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated\ncontent across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms\nthat characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments.

Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label\nrefinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies\nby identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters.

In this\nwork, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as\nout-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by\nassociating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across\nfive prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and\nhallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally\nrelated. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we\nthen formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that\na one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and\nvalue matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined\nweights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure\nexplains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high\nsample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely\nspurious.
