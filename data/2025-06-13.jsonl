Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on\nsingle-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods\nprimarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,\nthus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens\nmodels' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a\nprompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies\nfor KGQA.

Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:\n(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question\nsemantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question\nrewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing\nanswer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.\nBy adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA\nutilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation\nand thus improve answer retrieval performance.

In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused\nRetrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from\nlong context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect\nto the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,\nlong-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and\neffective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as\nretrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting\nthe most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop\nreasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains\nover full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate\nQRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves\nstrong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as\nRankGPT.

This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed.

Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

Instead of relying on existing\nimplementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground\nup approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we\ndemonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training\nof LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,\nand show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's\ncapabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal\nunderstanding, instruction following and function calling.

While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that\nneurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing\ndirections in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely\non dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over\nresidual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs\noften struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as\ntheir learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,\nwe tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with\nsemi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features\nare (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to\ntheir activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on\nLlama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs\nand a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,\nwhile aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that\nspecific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,\nexposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,\nthese results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying\ninterpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs."}

However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of\n\"epistemic friction,\" or the inherent resistance encountered when updating\nbeliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this\npaper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic\nintegration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current\nbelief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position\nthis within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,\n2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the\ninteraction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that\ndemonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief\nupdates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief\nalignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be\nmade more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue\nscenarios."}

Code is at https://github.com/innovatingAI/AutoMind", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing\nreal-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to\nautomate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world\neffectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined\nworkflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on\nrelatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical\nexpertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this\nwork, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework\nthat overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated\nexpert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an\nagentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores\npossible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically\ntailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data\nscience benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance\nversus state-of-the-art baselines.

A natural question that arises is how\neffectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question\nby investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types\nof unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to\nthe question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different\nquestion, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are\neffective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from\nthe same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing\nsignificant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of\nreasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their\nself-reevaluation abilities are far from a general \"meta-cognitive\" awareness.\nMoreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle\nmore than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when\ninstructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of\nthese findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,\nshowing that the smallest models are the least distracted by\nharmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for\nimprovement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better\nreasoning and safer systems."}
