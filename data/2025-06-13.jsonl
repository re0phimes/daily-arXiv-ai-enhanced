Recent methods utilizing large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are\nlimited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning\nsamples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on\nsingle-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods\nprimarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,\nthus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens\nmodels' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a\nprompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies\nfor KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by\ncrafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual\ncontent, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)\npairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:\n(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question\nsemantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question\nrewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing\nanswer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.\nBy adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA\nutilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation\nand thus improve answer retrieval performance.

In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused\nRetrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from\nlong context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect\nto the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,\nlong-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and\neffective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as\nretrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting\nthe most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop\nreasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains\nover full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate\nQRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves\nstrong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as\nRankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring\nand task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream\nutility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers\ninterpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs."}

We answer this question with Resa,\na family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse\nautoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to\ncapture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE\nto guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in\na target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning\ntraces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL\npost-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's\nreasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \\$1\nand training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to\nlightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning\nperformance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only\naround \\$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via\nSAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities\nextracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and\noverlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math\ncan be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,\nand yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all\nartifacts are fully open-sourced."}

It is\nnonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a\nsignificant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered\nthrough the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)\nparticular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the\nmindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a\ndataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of\nopen-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different\ncontroversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under\ntypical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating\nmodels, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release\ntheir fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This\nresult is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the\nvulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result\nhas implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally\napplicable and realistic LLM use case."}

In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle\ntoxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited\nlabeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and\nTikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,\npolitics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and\ngeneral topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude\n3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured\nprecision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a\nshort context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1\nscore by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best\nbalance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of\n0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the\nlowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic\nlanguage detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies\nsuch as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show\nthat prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for\nunderserved Balkan language communities."}

Existing moderators mainly\npractice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based\non the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more\nattention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway\nand early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply\nmoderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,\nintroducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this\npaper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports\npartial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of\n29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable\nsupervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content\nmonitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level\nlabels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of\nharmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is\ncomparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in\nresponses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness\nannotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness\nscore than DPO."}
